passive-film-model
==================
Note: This is a work in progress

The passive film model is a coupled kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) and phase field (PF) method to simulate the multiscale behavior of multi-phase passive films in electrochemical environments.
Requires: [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) 3.2 for solving phase-field equations and [SPPARKS](http://spparks.sandia.gov/) for performing 2D kMC

The code is partly documented using [ford](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford). More documentation is on the way.
