  abstract = {{P}roduction of acid mine drainage ({AMD}) is in large part due to
	pyrite oxidation. {T}he tie-in between environmental remediation
	and pyrite oxidation requires understanding pyrite oxidation in aqueous
	systems. {I}n this study, ex-situ measurements using vertical scanning
	interferometry ({VSI}) were utilized to investigate pyrite surface
	reactivity under {AMD} conditions, such as p{H} 1 ({HCI}), an {O}-2-saturated
	atmosphere, and room temperature, including (1) ex-situ measurements
	using vertical scanning interferometry ({VSI}) and (2) solution chemistry
	measurements using a flow reactor. {I}n the former, two fragments
	were immersed in the acidic solution for 27 days at undersaturation
	with respect to pyrite. {W}eathered surfaces of pyrite that showed
	surface history (e.g., existence of terraces, steps, etch pits, and
	non-uniform surface roughness) were selected to examine surface topography
	changes with time.|{B}ased on the {VSI} measurements, the reaction
	mechanism includes the formation and coalescence of etch pits leading
	to overall surface retreat. {T}his result is consistent with the
	stepwave model that predicts that, under sufficiently high undersaturation
	(i.e., {D}elta {G} < {D}elta {G}(crit)), pit opening and generation
	of stepwaves are mechanisms that control mineral dissolution. {S}urface
	reactivity was not uniform over the entire surface, yielding surface
	regions with a considerable variety of dissolution rates that ranged
	from 1.7 x 10(-7) mol/(m(2 center dot)s) to lower than 2 x 10(-11)
	mol/(m(2 center dot)s). {T}he overall pyrite dissolution rate calculated
	over the explored surface was 2.8 x 10(-9) mol/(m(2 center dot)s),
	which agrees very well with the absolute rate measured [3.1 x 10(-9)
	mol/(m(2 center dot)s)].|{B}ased on the release of {F}e in the flow
	experiment and normalizing with the geometric surface area, the steady-state
	pyrite dissolution rate obtained was 7.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(-9) mol/(m(2-)s),
	i.e., a factor of about 2 higher than that determined by {VSI}. {C}ollectively,
	these rates also agree with pyrite dissolution rates obtained by
	bulk dissolution measurements. {T}hese results highlight (1) "local"
	dissolution rates vary widely over mineral surfaces at the short
	range scale from nano- to millimeter lengths; (2) inferred dissolution
	rates that are usually based on topographic changes on rather small
	(micrometer-scale size) surface regions are not necessarily representative
	of rates under field conditions; and (3) {BET} surface area and geometric
	surface area associated with reactive surface area and used to normalize
	the pyrite dissolution rates yield a variation in rate that ranges
	from 6.3 x 10(-11) to 7.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(-9) mol/(m(2 center dot){S}).},

	correlation coefficients for these regression models were relatively
